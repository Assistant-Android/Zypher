## 🚀 Overview
**Zypher** is a custom **AI platform revolutionizing exoplanet discovery**.  
It uses advanced **machine learning models** to automatically detect potential exoplanets from NASA’s open datasets.  
With over **90% accuracy** and processing speeds under **2 seconds per star**, Zypher brings automation, scalability, and precision to the next generation of space research.

---

## 🪐 Problem
Astronomers must sift through **millions of light curves** — most of which are false positives.  
Manual verification takes **months**, introduces **human bias**, and cannot keep up with the **growing telescope data** from missions like **Kepler** and **TESS**.  
Existing tools are often slow and limited in accuracy, making **automation essential** for faster and more reliable discovery.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
Zypher introduces an **AI/ML-based hybrid ensemble model** for detecting and verifying exoplanets.  
It integrates **multiple space mission datasets** and applies **astrophysics-inspired feature engineering** to identify true planetary candidates with high accuracy.  
The system includes an **interactive research dashboard**, **AI chatbot**, and **custom training modules** for users — creating a unified platform for discovery, visualization, and exploration.
